# Eat the Wich!
Eat-Da-Wich! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of wiches they'd like to eat.
Whenever a user submits a wich's name, your app will display the wich on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.
Each wich in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the wich will move to the right side of the page.


The app stores this backend data in a MySQL DB to keep track of whether the wich is devoured or not.
